# Owl Tree (WIP)
A C++ and C# framework for server-client RPCs intended for games.

Select either the `cpp` or `cs` branch to view the source code.

# C# 

The C# version of Owl Tree is developed with .NET 8.0. Dependencies are limited to the standard library.\
The actual framework is contained in the `src` folder. The actual C# project is purely for testing.\
If you want to use the framework, copy the contents of the `src` folder into your project.
